Any reports or actions taken during a Board meeting shall be filed with the corporate records.  All minutes must be reviewed and approved by the Board at the next regular meeting.<br/><br/>

                    Section 14.       Voting and Action by the Board.   At all meetings of the Board, each director shall have one vote.  The vote of a majority of the directors present at the meeting at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to constitute action of the Board except for actions for which a greater vote may be required by statute, the Articles, or these Bylaws.  A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for the meeting.<br/><br/>

                    Section 15.       Proxy Vote.   Proxies and proxy voting shall not be allowed on behalf of any director.<br/><br/>

                    Section 16.       Compensation of Directors.   No director shall receive any compensation from the Corporation for services rendered as a director.  No director shall serve the Corporation in any other capacity and receive compensation from the Corporation for such services.

                        (a)            A Public Official Director sitting on the Board will not have a conflict of interest if the Corporation should contract with his or her jurisdiction to perform a component of the program.<br/><br/>

Any indemnification under this Article (unless the indemnification is ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances.  In the case of indemnification under Section 1 (a) of this Article, the determination shall be limited to whether the person to be indemnified has met the standards specified in Section 1 of this Article and that the amount of the indemnification is permitted by law.  Any determination under this Section shall be made (a) by the Board by a majority vote of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding, (b) if such a quorum is not obtainable, by majority vote of a committee designated by the Board consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding, or (c) by special legal counsel selected by the Board or a committee as provided in clause (a) or (b) of this sentence or, if a quorum cannot be obtained under (a) and a committee cannot be designated under (b), the special legal counsel shall be selected by majority vote of the full Board, in which directors who are parties to the proceeding may participate.<br/><br/>

                        Section 3.         Advance Payments.     Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, as authorized by the Board in the specific case, upon receipt of (i) a written affirmation from the director, officer, employee or agent of his or her good faith belief that he or she is entitled to indemnification as authorized in this Article; and (ii) an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount, unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in the Article.<br/><br/>

                        Section 4.         Non-Exclusivity and Continuation.      The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification may be entitled under any agreement, vote of disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in the person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.<br/><br/>

                        Section 5.         Insurance.        The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance (a) to insure itself with respect to the indemnification payments it is authorized or obligated to make pursuant to this Article, and (b) on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, to insure against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify the person against such liability under the provisions of this Article.<br/><br/>
